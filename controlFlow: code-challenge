CONTROL FLOW
-- In Range
Let’s start the advanced challenge problems by testing if a number falls within a certain range.
We will accept three parameters where the first parameter is the number we are testing, the second parameter is the lower bound and the third parameter is the upper bound of our range.
These are the steps required:

1.Define the function to accept three numbers as parameters
2.Test if the number is greater than or equal to the lower bound and less than or equal to the upper bound
3.If this is true, return True, otherwise, return False

Create a function named in_range() that has three parameters named num, lower, and upper.
The function should return True if num is greater than or equal to lower and less than or equal to upper. Otherwise, return False.

def in_range(num, lower, upper):
  if (num >= lower and num <= upper):
    return True
  return False

print(in_range(10, 10, 10))
# should print True
print(in_range(5, 10, 20))
# should print False

-- Same Name
We need to write a program that checks different names and determines if they are equal.
We need to accept two strings and compare them. Here are the steps:

1.Define the function to accept two strings, your_name and my_name
2.Test if the two strings are equal
3.Return True if they are equal, otherwise return False
Create a function named same_name() that has two parameters named your_name and my_name.
If our names are identical, return True. Otherwise, return False.

def same_name(your_name, my_name):
  if(your_name == my_name):
    return True
  else:
    return False

print(same_name("Colby", "Colby"))
# should print True
print(same_name("Tina", "Amber"))
# should print False

 -- Always False
There are some situations that you normally want to avoid when programming using conditional statements. One example is a contradiction. This occurs when your condition will always be false no matter what value you pass into it.
Let’s create an example of a function that contains a contradiction. It will contain a few steps:
1.Define the function to accept a single parameter called num
2.Use a combination of <, > and and to create a contradiction in an if statement.
3.If the condition is true, return True, otherwise return False. The trick here is that because we’ve written a contradiction, the condition should never be true, so we should expect to always return False.

Create a function named always_false() that has one parameter named num.
Using an if statement, your variable num, and the operators >, and <, make it so your function will return False no matter what number is stored in num.
An if statement that is always false is called a contradiction. You will rarely want to do this while programming, but it is important to realize it is possible to do this.

def always_false(num):
  if (num > 0 & num < 0):
    return True
  else:
    return False

print(always_false(0))
# should print False
print(always_false(-1))
# should print False
print(always_false(1))
# should print False

-- Movie Review
We want to create a function that will help us rate movies. Our function will split the ratings into different ranges and tell the user how the movie was based on the movie’s rating.
Here are the steps needed:
1.Define our function to accept a single number called rating
2.If the rating is equal to or less than 5, return "Avoid at all costs!"
3.If the rating was less than 9, return "This one was fun."
4.If neither of the if statement conditions were met, return "Outstanding!"

Create a function named movie_review() that has one parameter named rating.
If rating is less than or equal to 5, return "Avoid at all costs!".
If rating is between 5 and 9, return "This one was fun.". If rating is 9 or above, return "Outstanding!"

def movie_review(rating):
  if(rating <= 5):
    return("Avoid at all costs!")
  if(rating <= 8):
    return("This one was fun.")
  else:
    return("Outstanding!")

print(movie_review(9))
# should print "Outstanding!"
print(movie_review(4))
# should print "Avoid at all costs!"
print(movie_review(6))
# should print "This one was fun."

-- Max Number
For the final challenge, we are going to select which number from three input values is the greatest using conditional statements. 
To do this, we need to check the different combinations of values to see which number is greater than the other two.
Here is what we need to do:
1.Define a function that has three input parameters, num1, num2, and num3
2.Test if num1 is greater than the other two numbers
If so, return num1
3.Test if num2 is greater than the other two numbers
If so, return num2
4.Test if num3 is greater than the other two numbers
If so, return num3
5.If there was a tie between the two largest numbers, then return "It's a tie!"

def max_num(num1, num2, num3):
  if(num1 > num2 and num1 > num3):
    return num1
  elif(num2 > num1 and num2 > num3):
    return num2
  elif(num3 > num1 and num3 > num2):
    return num3
  else:
    return "It's a tie!"
    
print(max_num(-10, 0, 10))
# should print 10
print(max_num(-10, 5, -30))
# should print 5
print(max_num(-5, -10, -10))
# should print -5
print(max_num(2, 3, 3))
# should print "It's a tie!"
