#Two-Dimensional (2D) Lists
#Previously, we saw that we could create a list representing both Noelle’s name and height:

heights = [["Noelle", 61], ["Ava", 70], ["Sam", 67], ["Mia", 64]]

#add one more person
heights = [["Jenny", 61], ["Alexus", 70], ["Sam", 67], ["Grace", 64], ["Vik", 68]]

#Accessing 2D Lists
Let’s return to our classroom heights example:

heights = [["Noelle", 61], ["Ali", 70], ["Sam", 67]]

#Two-dimensional lists can be accessed similar to their one-dimensional counterpart. 
#Instead of providing a single pair of brackets [ ] we will use an additional set for each dimension past the first.
#If we wanted to access "Noelle"‘s height:

#Access the sublist at index 0, and then access the 1st index of that sublist. 

noelles_height = heights[0][1] 
print(noelles_height)
#Would output: 61

#Tasks
1.We want to have a way to store all of our classroom test score data.
Using the provided table, create a two-dimensional list called class_name_test to represent the data. Each sublist in class_name_test should have one student’s name and their associated score.

Name	Test Score
"Jenny"	90
"Alexus"	85.5
"Sam"	83
"Ellie"	101.5

Print class_name_test to see the result.

class_name_test = [["Jenny", 90], ["Alexus", 85.5], ["Sam", 83], ["Ellie", 101.5]]
print(class_name_test)


2.Use double square brackets ([][]) to select Sam‘s test score from the list class_name_test.
Save it to the variable sams_score.
Print the variable sams_score to see the result.

sams_score = class_name_test[2][1]
print(sams_score)


3.Use double square brackets ([][]) to select Ellies test score from the list class_name_test. This time only use negative indices!
Save it to the variable ellies_score.
Print the variable ellies_score to see the result.

ellies_score = class_name_test[-1][-1]
print(ellies_score)

#Modifying 2D Lists

class_name_hobbies = [["Jenny", "Breakdancing"], ["Alexus", "Photography"], ["Grace", "Soccer"]]

#"Jenny" changed their mind and is now more interested in "Meditation".
We will need to modify the list to accommodate the change to our class_name_hobbies list. 
To change a value in a two-dimensional list, reassign the value using the specific index.
The list of Jenny is at index 0. The hobby is at index 1. 

class_name_hobbies[0][1] = "Meditation"
print(class_name_hobbies)
#Would output:
[["Jenny", "Meditation"], ["Alexus", "Photography"], ["Grace", "Soccer"]]

#Tasks:
1.create a two-dimensional list called incoming_class to represent the data. Each sublist in incoming_class should contain the name, nationality, and grade for a single student.

Name	Nationality	Grade Level
"Kenny"	"American"	9
"Tanya"	"Ukrainian"	9
"Madison"	"Indian"	7

Print incoming_class to see our list.

incoming_class = [["Kenny", "American", 9], ["Tanya", "Ukrainian", 9], ["Madison", "Indian", 7]]
print(incoming_class)

2."Madison" passed an exam to advance a grade. She will be pushed into 8th grade rather than her current 7th in our list.
Modify the list using double brackets [][] to make the change. Use positive indices.
Print incoming_class to see our change.

incoming_class[2][2] = 8
print(incoming_class) 

3."Kenny" likes to be called by his nickname "Ken". Modify the list using double brackets [][] to accommodate the change but only using negative indices.
Print incoming_class to see our change.

incoming_class[-3][-3] = "Ken"
print(incoming_class)
