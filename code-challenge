-- In Range
Letâ€™s start the advanced challenge problems by testing if a number falls within a certain range.
We will accept three parameters where the first parameter is the number we are testing, the second parameter is the lower bound and the third parameter is the upper bound of our range.
These are the steps required:

1.Define the function to accept three numbers as parameters
2.Test if the number is greater than or equal to the lower bound and less than or equal to the upper bound
3.If this is true, return True, otherwise, return False

Create a function named in_range() that has three parameters named num, lower, and upper.
The function should return True if num is greater than or equal to lower and less than or equal to upper. Otherwise, return False.

def in_range(num, lower, upper):
  if (num >= lower and num <= upper):
    return True
  return False

print(in_range(10, 10, 10))
# should print True
print(in_range(5, 10, 20))
# should print False

2.  Same Name
We need to write a program that checks different names and determines if they are equal.
We need to accept two strings and compare them. Here are the steps:

1.Define the function to accept two strings, your_name and my_name
2.Test if the two strings are equal
3.Return True if they are equal, otherwise return False
Create a function named same_name() that has two parameters named your_name and my_name.
If our names are identical, return True. Otherwise, return False.
